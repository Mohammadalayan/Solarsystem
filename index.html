        In Depth | Pluto – NASA Solar System Exploration
        Pluto's orbit around the Sun is unusual compared to the planets: it's both elliptical and tilted. Pluto's 248-year-long, oval-shaped orbit can take it as far as 49.3 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, and as close as 30 AU.</p></figcaption></div>

    <figcaption><p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past.</p></figcaption></div>

It is not the only planet to have rings – made of chunks of ice and rock – but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.</p></figcaption></div></div>

  <div class="col"><div class="card" ><img src="whatsimporta.jpg"alt="marcury"></div><figcaption><p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It's a little bigger than Earth's Moon. It is the closest planet to the Sun, but it's actually not the hottest. Venus is hotter.

  <div class="col-3"><div class="card"><img src="R (1).jpg" alt="Venus">
  <figcaption><p>Venus is often called "Earth’s twin" because they’re similar in size and structure, but Venus has extreme surface heat and a dense, toxic atmosphere. If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth and Venus would each be about the size of a nickel.</p></figcaption></div></div>
   
  <div class="col-3"><div class="card"id="im"><img src="planet-uranus-by-voyager-2-in-1986.jpg" alt="uranus"><figcaption><p>Uranus, the seventh planet from the sun, may initially look like a bland, blue-green ball. But there's a lot to love about the icy giant, from its 13 rings to its 27 known moons to the fact that it may even rain diamonds from its hazy atmosphere.</p></figcaption></div></div>
    <div class="col-3"><div class="card"id="Neptune" ><img src="R (2).jpg" alt="neptune"><figcaption><p>Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known planet in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. </p></figcaption>

</div><div class="col-3"><div class="card" id="Earth"><img src="OIP (1).jpg"alt="Earth"> <figcaption><p>Earth is a rocky planet with a solid and dynamic surface of mountains, canyons, plains and more. Most of our planet is covered in water. Earth's atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other ingredients—the perfect balance to breathe and live. Earth has one moon. Earth has no rings.
